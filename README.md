## About HYUNGSEOK

This project is a personal project for my development record and my daily life record. The PHP [Laravel](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) framework was used to build the home page. I want to get feedback on what I've developed, and I hope everyone can come and show off their own diaries and hobbies.
